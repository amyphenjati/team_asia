                <h1>What is DEPRESSION?</h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Depression is a medical disorder that causes a person to experience extreme
                    feelings of sadness and hopelessness.
                    It is natural to temporarily feel down from time to time, especially if you are going through a loss
                    or stressful situation, but depression is more than that.
                    If these feelings are intense and persist over weeks or months, and if they stop you enjoying or
                    even doing your normal activities, it’s likely that you have depression.
                    Some people may struggle with depression for months to years. Depression can be a serious mental
                    illness resulting in thoughts of suicide and self-harm.
                </h5>
                <h3>Causes of Depression</h3>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Depression is a complex illness. An imbalance in brain chemicals called
                    neurotransmitters can be a factor of depression.
                    Factors such as genetic characteristics allow one to be vulnerable to developing depression than
                    others.

                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                    There are several types of depression. The most common include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Major Depression</b> — severe symptoms that interfere with your ability to work, sleep,
                            concentrate, eat, and enjoy life. A person may experience multiple episodes.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)</b> — depression symptoms that are less severe
                            than those of major depression. Dysthymia last longer than major despression, usually at
                            least two years.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Minor Depression</b> - depression symptoms that are less severe than those of major
                            depression and dysthymia, and symptoms do not last long.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h1>How to Get Help</h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                    You may feel reluctant or embarrassed to seek advice, but remember that depression is common, and
                    getting help for depression is not a sign of weakness.<br>
                    Depression is not something you can treat on your own, and it is important that you seek help from
                    mental health professional. The right treatment may help improve your overall health and quality of
                    life. With the right treatment, you may begin to see improvements as early as two weeks from the
                    start of your therapy. Some symptoms may start to improve within a week or two, but it may be
                    several weeks before you feel the full effect.
