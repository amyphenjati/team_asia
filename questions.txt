I have lost interest in things I used to like to do.

I feel hopeless about my future.

I find it more difficult than it should be to make decisions.
 
I feel sluggish and often get tired for no reason.

I am gaining or losing weight without intending to.

I feel helpless to make changes Iâ€™d like to make in my life.

I am sleeping too much, or too little.

I often feel unhappy or sad, or easily cry.

I easily become irritable or anxious.

I think about dying or killing myself.
