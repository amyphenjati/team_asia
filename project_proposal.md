### **Team Thailand Project Proposal**

1. **The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?**

The main idea of our project is to develop a **text detection** program from an image. More specifically, we hope to create a web application that allows users to take a photo of a grocery product&#39;s **name and expiration date** , which will be read as a text input to be stored in a database. In addition, the application will **alert** users on products that are close to expiring. The minimum viable product is a functional web application that has the above features. However, a stretch goal for the project is an iOS or Android application version of the program.

In a more personal tone, the objective of this program is to automate an everyday task and reduce waste as we, the team members, share a common struggle of finding old grocery products in the fridge/shelve and having to throw them out â€“ regretting and being mad at ourselves for &quot;forgetting about them&quot;.

2. **Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.**

The objective of this project aligns with our desire to seek new ways to increase efficiency in our everyday lives and make small contributions to saving the environment by reducing food waste in our homes. In order to do so, we hope to improve and build confidence in our coding upon the completion of this project on an individual level as we will be exposed to new tools and functions on Python beyond class content.

On a team level, we hope to get our hands on a complete software development life cycle, which involves heavy collaboration, teamwork, planning, and execution. Though the COVID-19 pandemic prevented us from returning on campus, we are fortunate enough to be in the same geographic location. On that note, we aim to use that to our advantage in setting up in-person meetings to discuss our concerns, findings, and potential ideas. Overall, we hope to move forward together as a team and get a feel of what it is like to start programming from scratch.

3. **Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture, you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don&#39;t have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.**

In implementing our project plan, we will be using the following two libraries:

- OpenCV: to work with images using IP webcam
- Pytessaract for optical character recognition (OCR)

We are aware that our knowledge of coding is very limited. Hence, we will be consulting online sources and experts in the field, for instance, Professor Li or friends who do Python for their job, for advice and guidance when needed.

4. **Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.**

| **Week** | **Task**           | **Details**                                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1   | Idea generation    | Narrowing down the scope and determining our project idea, doing preliminary research |
| Week 2   |
|          |
|          |
| Week 3   |
|          |
|          |
| Week 4   |
|          |
|          |
| Week 5   |
|          |
|          |
| Week 6   |
|          |
|          |
| Week 7   |
|          |
|          |
| Week 8   | Project completion | Fix minor bugs and finalize our project, ready to be used and presented to the class  |

5. **Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.**

The organizational structure we will be adapting is a combination of individual research, pair, and group programming sessions. Individual research will be done in the earlier stages of the project. The choice to assign this task individually is to widen the scope of our research as we will now have three, not one, parties conducting the research. After our preliminary research, we will be applying the pair and group programming system as we believe coming up with the code is a crucial part of the project. As mentioned above, our team is able to set up face-to-face meetings, thus, we hope to meet on a weekly basis and prior to turning in our deliverables.

6. **Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?**

We are all equally inexperienced in Python, therefore it would be difficult to provide support to each other should a coding issue come up. Time is also a risk because, in eight weeks, we have to learn and apply the new knowledge to the project, while applying for jobs and work on other school work. We are addressing the risk by narrowing down the scope of the project, therefore it will increase the feasibility and the goals will be more achievable.

7. **Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?**

OpenCV: to work with images using IP webcam

Pytessaract for optical character recognition (OCR)

Progressive Web App
