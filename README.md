### [Project Website](https://amyphenjati.github.io/team_asia/)

- The final website is worth 10% of the project grade
  
Your project website is the lasting record of what you have accomplished over the course of this project, and hopefully a valuable contribution to your professional portfolio. You should draw upon all the deliverables and activities above to create the final site, combining, reformatting, and adding to them to effectively tell the story of your project.

  
There are many successful formats for a project website, but you should consider including:
### **Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?**
  
    Quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about. Consider including a narrative or example use case, e.g. via screenshots, video, or story boarding.
### **User instructions/README**
  
    Information to help users download, install, and get started running your software. [Here](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates) is a collection of awesome README templates to get some ideas.

### **Implementation information**
  
    Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural or class diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.

### **Results**
  
    Though the details will be different for each project, show off what your software can do! Screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or other data if appropriate.

### **Project evolution/narrative**
  
    Tell an illustrative story about the process of creating your software, showing how it improved over time. This may draw upon what you learned from the two peer technical reviews. Consider the use of screenshots or other tools to demonstrate how your project evolved.

**Note**: These content prompts exist to inspire your thinking, and you should use whatever organization and sections make sense for your project and the story you're telling. Simply answering the given prompts sequentially is not the strongest way to communicate your work to an external audience. Think about what you've accomplished and frame it nicely - finish strong!
